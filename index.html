      <h2>Proposition: Black and Hispanic civilians are disproportionately targeted by police force complaints compared to White civilians.</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="supporting.png" alt="Chart showing total complaints by ethnicity" />
          <figcaption>Total Complaints by Civilian Ethnicity</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aggregating total complaints by ethnicity</strong><br>
          Score: +2 (Fully earnest)<br>
          We grouped complaints by civilian ethnicity to visualize overall complaint patterns. Aggregation also simplifies the visualization, making it easier to digest for a broad audience without losing the story. This shows the scale of civilian-police interactions across groups, clearly revealing disproportionate targeting patterns. Essentially, large visible bars for Black and Hispanic civilians immediately communicate disparity. Alternatively, we could have normalized by city population, but leaving it as raw totals makes the disparity look more severe and serves as an intentional persuasive choice.</li>
        
          <li><strong>Highlighting force complaints with lighter opacity</strong><br>
          Score: +1.5 (Mostly earnest)<br>
          We used transparency to show that force complaints are a serious subset of total complaints. Using transparency allows viewers to see both the total complaint volume and the subset of force complaints simultaneously, providing context without obscuring either dataset. This layering shows both prevalence and intensity of allegations and emphasizes how frequently force complaints occur among already high complaint totals. Essentially, the “ghosted” overlay subtly amplifies the sense of accumulation and seriousness. On the contrary, if we used a different color instead of altering the opacity, the chart would be less emotionally resonant.</li>
        
          <li><strong>Using total number of complaints</strong><br>
          Score: +1 (Earnest)<br>
          We chose to visualize the total number of complaints by civilian ethnicity rather than other metrics because the raw counts make the racial disparities in complaints more visually striking, directly supporting the proposition that Black and Hispanic civilians are disproportionately targeted. Using totals highlights the scope of the issue without minimizing it through normalization or secondary metrics. This approach makes the disparity appear more drastic and immediately noticeable, strengthening the argument’s emotional and visual impact. If we had utilized a different metric such as showing complaints per capita would likely reduce the visible gap between groups and weaken the persuasive clarity of the chart.</li>
        
          <li><strong>Sorting groups by total complaint count</strong><br>
          Score: -0.5 (Slightly deceptive)<br>
          We decided to order the bars from most to fewest complaints which makes disparities instantly visible. This choice capitalizes on pre-attentive processing as it directs the reader’s attention to the groups with the most complaints first. This choice directs attention strategically to the groups most affected, making the argument visually and psychologically persuasive. It reinforces a clear hierarchy of disparity without manipulating the underlying data. Alternatively, if we had sorted the bars alphabetically, the data would appear more neutral but less impactful.</li>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="project2.png" alt="Chart showing complaints per substantiated case" />
          <figcaption>Complaint Substantiation Rates by Civilian Ethnicity</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Using cool and desaturated colors</strong><br>
          Score: +1.5 (Mostly earnest)<br>
          Because neutral tones reduce emotional cues, we decided to utilize blue for the bars across all groups while coloring the national average line red for clear contrast. The blue palette reinforces objectivity and professionalism, making the visualization appear neutral and data-driven. The red reference line draws subtle attention to the national benchmark without overwhelming the rest of the chart. This color scheme looks analytical and fair-minded while simultaneously still guiding viewers’ attention to the key comparison point (the national average). Using warmer tones for the bars could have introduced emotional bias, while keeping the benchmark line the same color as the bars would make it harder to notice.</li>
        
          <li><strong>Using a balanced, non-accusatory title</strong><br>
          Score: +1 (Earnest)<br>
          Rather than phrasing our title as a question, our title was a statement. Essentially, we decided to frame the title as a neutral which supports the idea of equality without directly denying disparities. It also avoids emotionally charged language that could bias interpretation while still highlighting disparities in a clear way. The neutral title strengthens the chart’s credibility, encouraging viewers to accept the observed differences as meaningful without feeling manipulated. Alternatively, a dramatic or emotionally charged title could have drawn immediate attention but risked appearing biased or manipulative, undermining trust in the visualization.</li>
        
          <li><strong>Adding a national average line</strong><br>
          Score: +0.5 (Slightly Earnest)<br>
          We included a national reference line from external resources to provide context because it helps the viewer interpret whether groups are above or below a certain benchmark. In our chart, all groups fall below the national average, hovering around 4 complaints filed per substantiated case which visually highlights that substantiation is low across the board. This choice adds credibility by situating our data within a national context, reinforcing the impression that the differences between groups are relatively small and potentially insignificant. However, omitting the line would make the chart less interpretable and remove a key visual anchor for understanding what “low” or “high” means in this context.</li>
        
          <li><strong>Truncating the y-axis</strong><br>
          Score: -1.5 (Deceptive)<br>
          We zoomed out the y-axis in order to extend the range beyond the actual data, making all bars appear closer in height. By expanding the scale, we visually minimized differences between groups’ substantiation rates, making them seem nearly uniform. This framing supports the idea of fairness by flattening visible disparities, suggesting that substantiation outcomes are similar across civilian ethnicities even if small differences exist numerically. Using a tighter axis range would make those small differences appear larger and more noticeable, which could challenge the opposition’s argument.</li>
        
          <li><strong>Using the complaints filed per one substantiated case</strong><br>
          Score: -1.5 (Mostly deceptive)<br>
          We showed only the proportion of complaints the CCRB substantiated because it shifts the attention from the number of complaints to how many were verified. More specifically, we calculated the complaints filed per one substantiated case in order to frame the narrative. Rather than displaying larger percentages, it shows smaller and more similar numbers, suggesting uniform treatment across all groups. Thus, even if total complaints differ drastically, depicting the complaints filed per substantiated case rather than just the plain substation rate rates reveal parity among groups. Alternatively, we could have presented both counts and rates together. However, this view would simplify the narrative and perception of the supporting view, not the opposition.</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Creating these two visualizations showed us how much presentation affects interpretation, even when the data is the same.<br>
        For the first chart, which supports the idea that there are racial disparities in NYPD complaints, we focused on showing total complaint counts.<br>
        Using strong red and green colors made the differences feel more dramatic and emotional, which helped make the point but also left out population context.<br>
        It was interesting to see how easy it is to make a visualization persuasive by just changing a few design choices.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The second chart took the opposite stance by reframing the data as complaints per substantiated case.<br>
        We used calm blue colors, a balanced layout, and a reference line to make everything feel more neutral and consistent.<br>
        It looked fairer, but we realized that it still guides how people read the data by focusing on a different metric.<br>
        What felt “objective” at first was really just another way of shaping the story.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Overall, this project made us think differently about what ethical visualization means.<br>
        It is not just about being accurate with the data but also being honest about how design choices influence perception.<br>
        We don’t think there is a strict line between persuasive and misleading visuals, but the intent matters.<br>
        If the goal is to clarify and inform, persuasion can be ethical.<br>
        When the goal is to hide or distort, that is when it crosses into deception.
